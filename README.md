# Client-Server Application 

Welcome to the Client-Server Application with Java. This project demonstrates a simple client-server architecture in Java, 
showcasing communication between a client and a server through socket connections. The project is under continuous development, 
with plans to add more features and improvements in future updates


## Project Structure
The project is divided into several key components:

Client: The client-side application that establishes a connection with the server, sends requests, and receives responses
Server: The server-side application that handles incoming client connections, processes requests, and sends back responses
Utils: Various utility classes for operations like JSON conversion, user interaction, and screen displaying
User Management: Contains classes and functionality related to users, including user data, admin operations, and user management
Mail System: Contain the mail-related features, with classes that manage mail details and individual mailboxes

## Project Overview
The application allows the client to send various requests to the server, which processes them and responds accordingly. Here are the main features:

Authentication: The client can register, log in, and log out. The server handles authentication and authorization
Mailbox Operations: The client can send messages, read from the mailbox, and perform other related operations
Admin Functions: The server includes admin capabilities for updating user data and other administrative tasks
